# Trello Groups

*This extension is based on [Swimlanes for Trello](https://github.com/jyaus/swimlanes-for-trello) by [Jeff Yaus](http://www.yaus.com/jeff/)*

Trello is a handy tool for keeping track of list items, but it limits you to a single row of lists. This lightweight, keep-it-simple extension for Trello allows you to create multiple horizontal "swimlanes" of lists.

* First, arrange your Trello lists. The lists for the first lane should come first, followed by the lists for the second lane, and so forth.
* Then, add the | character  to the header of any list that should start a new swimlane. 
* Any header text that comes after the character will be used as the lane's label. For instance, if you label a list with "Backlog for |Project X", that lane's label will read "Project X". (I recommend that you use a format like this, so that the list headers still make sense to people who don't have this extension.)
* Titles should be limited to approximately 20 characters. Long titles will cause strange formatting of the lists, but otherwise will not break anything.
